TechEd Australia 2012 - What's new in Windows 8 for developers
=============

A sample application I use at user group and conference talks.
The source code demonstrates how to use toast notifications in your own applications. The samples have been kept as simple as possible to allow you to copy / paste the code.

Talk abstract
-------

David Burela takes anyone new to Desktop development through the basics of developing for Windows 8. XAML, Databinding, DataTemplates and ViewModels will all be introduced. Discover how to separate your UI from your business logic, how to create List Views that display your data richly, how portable libraries can help your business logic be used cross platform, plus much more. The techniques will be focused on Windows 8, but can be applied to any XAML based application: WinRT, Windows Phone, WPF, Silverlight 5.

Session recording
--------

The recording of the session is available on MSDN Channel 9 [http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Australia/2012/DEV214](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Australia/2012/DEV214)

How to use this repository
--------

I have gone through and repeated the steps I took during my session. I then committed the code at specific milestones during the presentation. Each commit has been pre-fixed with the time stamp that corresponds with that point in the video.
